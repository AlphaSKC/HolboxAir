The aircraft regularly operating here include Cessna 182, Cessna 206, Piper Saratoga, Piper Seneca, Quest Kodiak, although records also show operations with Cessna Grand Caravans.<br/><br/>Unlike other airports where you might find shops, pharmacies, and restaurants, here there are no luxuries, but an atmosphere that reflects that of the island. The waiting area consists of a small palapa with rustic wooden seats. The army will handle random luggage inspection. Just a few steps away (40 meters), you can reach Pedro Joaqu√≠n Coldwell Street, where you can take a golf cart to your hotel..<br/><br/>Additionally, the Holbox runway lacks lights or other landing aids for pilots, so flights can only be operated during daylight hours. <br/><br/>The operating hours of the runway vary depending on the time of year, as the duration of daylight is longer in summer and shorter in winter.",
